The map includes NASA Blue Marble: Next Generation 500m resolution imagery at small scales (above 1:1,000,000), i-cubed 15m eSAT imagery at medium-to-large scales (down to 1:70,000) for the world, and USGS 15m Landsat imagery for Antarctica.  The map also includes i-cubed Nationwide Prime 1m or better resolution imagery  for the contiguous United States, Getmapping 1m imagery for Great Britain, and GeoEye IKONOS 1m resolution imagery for Hawaii, parts of Alaska, and several hundred metropolitan areas around the world. I-cubed Nationwide Prime is a seamless, color  mosaic of various commercial and government imagery sources, including Aerials  Express 0.3 to 0.6m resolution imagery for metropolitan areas and the best  available United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture  Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery and enhanced versions of United States Geological  Survey (USGS) Digital Ortho Quarter Quad (DOQQ) imagery for other areas.
