The Building and Environment Estimation Program (BEEP) is a plug-in for ArcGIS desktop developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help quantify outdoor surface materials and infrastructure details according to user-specified geographical areas. BEEP uses satellite imagery to estimate outdoor surface materials such as soil, concrete, asphalt, and vegetation, while infrastructure details are estimated using The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) USA Structures database. The results are aggregated and displayed within ArcGIS desktop and can be exported as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. BEEP is designed to provide a quick and efficient reporting tool for generating infrastructure and outdoor material estimates to support disaster response efforts, as well as an add-on component for decision support software tools.
